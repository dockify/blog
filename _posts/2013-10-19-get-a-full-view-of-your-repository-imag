We have a cool feature to share today that would make your life easier picking up [dockify](http://www.dockify.it). It's an ancestry of your repository that you can view by clicking on it's name. The ancestry helps you visualize the history of your projects and how it evolved by displaying a nice graph with each image and it's tag. This way it's easier for you and your team to create versions of whatever it is that you're creating because, at this time, it's hard to keep track and we "shoot in the dark" quite often.

If you liked this feature, wish something new, think that we miss features don't hesitate to contact us via live support or leave a comment right here. As always, we promise to respond ASAP
